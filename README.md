# Krypton Documentation

> Following docs are valid mainly for regular Krypton version 1 rev 3. For understanding the free version please refer to the source code

## 1. Understanding the syntax
Krypton uses very basic and easy-to learn syntax
```ts
(INSTRUCTION): // case-insensivite since krypton 1.2
[EXPRESSIONS]
```
This is what we call the **DoubleExecs** syntax.
It is made of two pieces, and is really easy to adap to. For example:
```ts
SWAPHOTBAR:
3
```
Changes hotbar to the 4th slot (because in decimal system 0 is the first index). Of course you can put diffent stuff, use mixed case and more. Lets take look at that:
```ts
swapHotbar:
30-(3^3) // this expression equals to 3
```
This code is equavilent to the one we shown before. More on this will be explained in later tutorial stages.

## 2. How-to?
You put krypton scripts in **.minecraft/krypton** folder.
They are executed automatically upon the **executor** is run. More 'bout executors in later tutorial.

Krypton scripts should follow a set of naming rules
```
FILENAME -> snake case ( krypton_script.ks )
VARIABLES -> upper snake case ( MY_VARIABLE )
```

## 3. Basics - Executors
To define an **executor** please use the standard DoubleExec syntax with exception on the chest trigger.

Here all the triggers:


**CHAT MESSAGE TRIGGER**
```
ONCHAT:
(Text)
```
The following triggers when message recieved by user contains specified Text.
> **ðŸ’¡ TIP:** This can be used for executing script from script. More in this in the "Practical uses and examples" section


**CHEST OPEN TRIGGER**
```
ONCHEST
```
Triggers on chest open. Note that this trigger is not like a regular expression!


**CHAT MESSAGE TRIGGER**
```
ONCHAT:
(Text)
```
The following triggers when message recieved by user contains specified Text.
> **ðŸ’¡ TIP:** This can be used for executing script from script. More in this in the "Practical uses and examples" section


**KEYBOARD TRIGGER**
```
ONKEY:
(Keycode)
```
The following triggers when the following key is clicked.

## 3. Basics - Arithmetics & Variables
First of all we need to see diffrent types of expressions. In krypton we have three types:

- Math expressions

Standard math. Nothing special.

- Text expressions

Normal text with variable support. Can't use any arithmetic operations.

- Universal expression

Expression where first character defines type. "$" means it is being parsed as text expression, "\*" is no parsing, and no symbol means traditional math parser.


We've also included special constans that can be used in math and text expressions. 

```
PLAYER_X
PLAYER_Y
PLAYER_Z
PLAYER_MOTION_X
PLAYER_MOTION_Y
PLAYER_MOTION_Z
PLAYER_HOTBAR_SLOT (incremeneted starting from 0)
PLAYER_EYEHEIGHT
PLAYER_ONGROUND (0 or 1)
PLAYER_SNEAKING (0 or 1)
```

__***FOR VARIALES, I WILL POST A FRAGMENT OF OLD DOCUMENTATION***__

**3. Variables**
To set variable use one of the two commands
```ts
SETVAL:
[Variable Name]:[Value as raw expression]
RSETVAL:
[Variable Name]:[Value as universal expression]
```
Here are usage examples:
```ts
SETVAL:
test:PLAYER_X 
```
In this example variable test will be "PLAYER_X"
```ts
RSETVAL:
test:PLAYER_X
```
In this example variable test will be equals to whatever the player x position is. For example if player x is 5, the variable will be 5

To reference variables in Expressions use following syntax:
```ts
VAR([variable name])
```
For example following code:
```ts
SETVAL:
test:-1
RSETVAL:
test:VAR(test)+1
```
Will set variable "test" to -1 then make it 0.
Note that operations like that:
```ts
SETVAL:
test:Hello
RSETVAL:
test:VAR(test)+1
```
Won't be executed and will terminate the program as the expression (Hello+1) can't be parsed properly. It would work properly if set like that:
```ts
SETVAL:
test:Hello
RSETVAL:
test:$VAR(test)1
```
With above example variable test will become "Hello1'

**4. Commands**

Here are the commands:

Clip (no bypass)
```ts
CLIP:
[MATH EXPRESSION - BLOCKS]:(UP/DOWN)
``` 
Click
```ts
CLICK:
(LEFT/RIGHT):[MATH EXPRESSION - DELAY]
``` 
Standard Output
```ts
PRINT:
[TEXT EXPRESSION - TEXT]
```
Look at block
```ts
LOOKAT:
[MATH EXPRESSION - X]:[MATH EXPRESSION - Y]:[MATH EXPRESSION - Z]
```
Look at block smooth
```ts
LOOKAT:
[MATH EXPRESSION - X]:[MATH EXPRESSION - Y]:[MATH EXPRESSION - Z]:[MATH EXPRESSION - MS]
```
Wait
```ts
WAIT:
[MATH EXPRESSION - TIME IN MS]
```
Break block
```ts
BREAKBLOCK:
[MATH EXPRESSION - X]:[MATH EXPRESSION - Y]:[MATH EXPRESSION - Z]
```
Swap hotbar
```ts
SWAPHOTBAR:
[MATH EXPRESSION - SLOT IN RANE 0~8]
```
Sneak
```ts
SNEAK:
[TEXT EXPRESSION - IGNORED]:(START/STOP)
```
Say
```ts

[TEXT EXPRESSION - WHAT TO SAY]
```
Click in GUIs
```ts
GUICLICK:
[MATH EXPRESSION - SLOT NUMBER - STARTING FROM 0]:[MATH EXPRESSION - MOUSE BUTTON]:[MATH EXPRESSION - MODE]

Examples:
```ts
Mouse Button 0 and Mode 0 is left click
Mouse Button 1 and Mode 0 is Right Click
Mouse Button 2 and Mode 0 is Middle Click (Shouldn't be used on Hypixel)
Mouse Button 2 and Mode 3 is Middle Click (Works on Hypixel)
Mouse Button 0/1 and Mode 4 is Dropping the Item
Mouse Button 0/1 and Mode 1 is quick moving the item
Mouse Button 0/1 and Mode 2 is swapping the item
```

**6. Control flow**

```ts
[LOOPTYPE]:
[MATH EXPRESSION - PARAMETER] OR [CONDITION EXPRESSION]

```

Conditional expressions (old documentation insert)

```ts
[MATHEXP]:HIGHER_THAN:[MATHEXP] 
1:HIGHER_THAN:0 (true)
[MATHEXP]:LOWER_THAN:[MATHEXP]
0:LOWER_THAN:1 (true)
[MATHEXP]:EQUALS:[MATHEXP]
0:EQUALS:0 (true)

WHILE:
[CONDITION EXPRESSION]
```

If loop

To access each coordinate use ITR(x), ITR(y), ITR(z)

# KryptonHUD Guide

Since all scripts share same memory, it can be accessed from diff ones.

All kryptonhud modules should be put in diffrent files and they should contain only kryptonhud

example:

```ts
INTERFACE:
[TYPE]
[PARAMETERS]
```

**TEXT DRAWING**

```ts
INTERFACE:
TEXT
(SHADOW/NORMAL):[TEXT EXPRESSION - TEXT]:[MATH EXRPESSION - X OFFSET]:[MATH EXRPESSION - Y OFFSET]:[MATH EXRPESSION - RGB COLOR CODE]
```

**RECTANGLE DRAWING**

```ts
INTERFACE:
TEXT
[MATH EXRPESSION - X OFFSET]:[MATH EXRPESSION - Y OFFSET]:[MATH EXRPESSION - X SIZE]:[MATH EXRPESSION - Y SIZE]:[MATH EXRPESSION - RGB COLOR CODE]
```
